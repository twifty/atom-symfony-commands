# Atom symfony-commands package

Run Symfony commands from within the editor.

##### Supports:
1. Symfony 2 and Symfony 3.
1. Interactive commands (For example `generate:bundle`).
1. Multiple open projects.
1. Running commands with all flags/options.
1. Auto completion of command name (uses `fuzzaldrin`).

The package also provides a modal window from which you can view all commands alongside the usage and help messages of each.

##### Limitations:
The Symfony project must be setup correctly in order to list or run commands. If a command cannot be run from the standard terminal, this package will also not be able to run it.
